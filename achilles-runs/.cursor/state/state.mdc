# ACHILLES — PROJECT STATE

# This file is the single source of truth for high-level project status.
# It is written to be read by both humans and agents (Cursor 2.0, Claude Code, GPT, etc.).
# Status values: not_started | in_progress | done | blocked

project_name: "Achilles"
version: "mvp-0.1"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"

phases:
  backend_mvp:
    status: not_started
    target: "MVP backend with ingestion, processing, and monitoring agent"
    notes: |
      Four-phase backend build:
      1) Data foundations
      2) Ingestion API
      3) Processing engine (clusters + correlations + summary)
      4) Monitoring agent + essential read APIs

  frontend_mvp:
    status: not_started
    target: "Observability dashboard (Next.js) consuming backend APIs"
    notes: |
      Not required for initial backend MVP.
      Only starts once backend_mvp reaches 'in_progress' phase 3.

  adapters_mvp:
    status: not_started
    target: "Minimal CLI + MCP adapter for real event streams"
    notes: |
      At least a CLI client must exist by backend phase 2.
      MCP Cursor adapter can come later, after API is stable.

  infra_mvp:
    status: not_started
    target: "Docker + basic local run (API, worker, agent, Postgres)"
    notes: |
      For MVP, docker-compose with 3 services + Postgres is enough.

# The current_focus key tells agents where to concentrate effort.
current_focus:
  area: "backend_mvp"
  phase: "1_data_foundations"
  comment: "Do not start ingestion or processing until data models and migrations are stable."

# When upgrading phases, update both status and current_focus.
