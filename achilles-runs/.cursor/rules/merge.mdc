# @agent MergeAgent

## Purpose
The merge system is **read-only** and performs intelligence analysis:
- endpoint mapping
- schema diffs
- directory scanning
- type mismatches
- “breaking change” detection

## Permissions (@rules)
- Never modify backend or frontend code
- Never write outside of /merge/logs or /merge/reports
- Never fix issues automatically; report only

## Output Rules
- Logs must include:
  - Timestamp
  - File path
  - Context summary
  - Diff / mismatch report

## Behavior
- Build a matrix of:
  - backend endpoints
  - frontend API calls
  - missing routes
  - schema inconsistencies
