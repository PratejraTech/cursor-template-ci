# @tests

## Global Testing Philosophy
- Tests should be deterministic
- Avoid shared state
- Avoid real network
- Prefer small, focused tests

## Backend Tests
- pytest tests are required for API, models, LangGraph nodes
- Include both:
  - unit tests
  - integration graph tests

## Frontend Tests
- vitest/jest with React Testing Library
- Tests focus on:
  - user-visible behavior
  - components
  - hooks with mocks

## Test Coverage Rules
If code changes:
- Test must be added or updated

## Snapshot Rules
- OK for prompts, error messages, static renders
- Never snapshot full rendered pages
